<p><a href="https://monday.com">Monday.com</a> is the tool we use for tracking tasks and capturing effort hours. Once a month, tasks are "posted" to <a href="/set-notegraph/notes/lu1kpevz2ad8zqmizeayr9n#^w7ccyzh70hn9">Smartsheet</a> for later reporting.</p>
<p>As of this date, their API is not sufficiently rich enough to support using it as the reporting system of record, thus the use of Smartsheet.</p>
